___To Do___

revisit access modifiers of members in classes - what should be private / public / protected? do I need to change/correct some of these?



GUI Design: 
	
	- Button to "Say UNO" for when player has one card left
	- UI element to display when each CPU player has called UNO (speech bubble looking thing?)

To Code:
	- (in progress) Turn system (right now, only Human P1 ever plays anything)
	- (in progress) Develop how Skip, Draw Two, and Draw Four do their Skipping (performSpecialBehavior() method in those Card subclasses)
	- Develop how Reverse switches the Turn Direction (flip boolean Game.turnDirection which will need to be used by Turn System)
	
	- (in progress) AI for computer controlled players to play cards
	- AI for computer players to "catch" a player that hasn't called UNO
	
	
Completed:
	- "You played a Wild! Which color is now in play?" selection
	- Win Conditions - out of cards
	- Card classes
	- Game, Deck, Player classes
	- tablePane is the GUI
	- UNOGameApp, the launcher
