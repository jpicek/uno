___To Do___

Future Additions and Ideas:
	- A clearer indicator of who's turn it is (whether Human or CPU player) would be helpful
	- it may actually be possible to empty the deck with just 4 players, and this possibility has not been coded for
      (if that does happen, will definitely result in an ArrayList error when the deck has no more cards)
    - AI Improvements:
	  - further improve AI for computer controlled players to play cards
	    (right now just play the first playable card it comes across, lol. this could maybe be improved with a better designed algorithm)
	  - AI for computer players to "catch" a player that hasn't called UNO
	    (requires UNO button + p2-4 indicators added)
	
Completed: 
	- Button to "Say UNO" for when player has one card left
	- CPU players "UNO" status added to Game Info
	- WildDrawFour was skipping turn immediately and not waiting for color selection from Human Player, this is now fixed
	- AI improved: playing Wild now changes to "favorite Color" instead of just RED all the time 
    - UI element to display arrow(s) for turn order (clockwise or counter)
	- Turn system (right now, only Human P1 ever plays anything)
	- Develop how Skip, Draw Two, and Draw Four do their Skipping (performSpecialBehavior() method in those Card subclasses)
	- Develop how Reverse switches the Turn Direction (flip boolean Game.turnDirection which will need to be used by Turn System)
	- Handle EDGE CASE: when the first discard card is either WILD: right now the only thing playable is another Wild... :/ what do the rules say even?
	- "You played a Wild! Which color is now in play?" selection
	- Win Conditions - out of cards
	- Wild color choice button images created and added
	- All card images created, re-named systematically, and added
	- Card classes
	- Game, Deck, Player classes
	- tablePane is the GUI, mostly designed, remaining GUI changes needed are shown above
	- UNOGameApp, the launcher
