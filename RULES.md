UNO Rules

Objective: to empty your hand first

Each turn, a player may do only 1 of the following actions:
 - play a card of matching color or number to the play pile
 - play a wild card, and change the color of play
 - or, draw a card (which can be played if possible)
 
Special cards include:
 - Skip (skip the next player's turn)
 - Draw Two (next player draws two cards and is skipped)
 - Reverse (reverse the direction of turn changes)
 - Wild (change the play color to the color of your choice)
 - Wild Draw Four (change the play color to the color of your choice,
   skip the next players turn and they draw 4 cards)

Calling UNO:
  - UNO must be signalled by a player who has only 1 card remaining
  - CPU Players will signal UNO 
  - A Human player who does not signal UNO has a chance of being caught
    by CPU players, which forces two cards to be drawn, so make sure
	that you press the UNO button when you're down to 1 card!
