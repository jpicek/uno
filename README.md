# uno
the uno card game, single player vs 3 CPU opponents
<br><br>

11/28/2021<br>
turn system implemented. To-do list better explained, and some new items added to it.


11/22/2021<br>
First project check-in due.
All of the classes are created, most of the game logic is created,
the game is fully playable but without turn-changing occuring.

The human player can play and win.

All cards play properly but don't necessarily do all of their special behaviors.
Playing of wild cards works.

See to-do for remaining changes needng to be made
