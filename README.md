First project check-in due.
All of the classes are created, most of the game logic is created,
the game is fully playable but without turn-changing occuring.

The human player can play and win.

All cards play properly but don't necessarily do all of their special behaviors.
Playing of wild cards works.

See to-do for remaining changes needng to be made
